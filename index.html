        <p style="text-align: justify;">of deans disagreed or strongly disagreed. Between 9% and 10% of the
chairpersons and the deans were neutral on the issue. Obviously, a substantial
majority of the accounting department chairpersons view Internet courses as
essentially correspondence courses delivered over the Internet while COB
deans are about evenly split on the issue. In the minds of those chairpersons,
any baggage that correspondence courses carried is apparently attached to
Internet courses.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responses to the second statement that “E courses should be offered in
accounting programs” were almost evenly split for the chairpersons and in
strong agreement for the deans. Slightly more than 36% of the chairpersons
and more than 56% of the deans indicated that Internet courses should be
offered in accounting programs. A relatively large portion, 26% and 32% of
the chairpersons and the deans respectively, chose the neutral response.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the same statement was posed relative to business programs,
chairs’ opinions shifted toward the agree end of the scale. Almost 46% of the
chairpersons and almost 68% of the deans agreed or strongly agreed with the
statement that “E-courses should be offered in Business programs,” while
only 16% of the chairs and 6% of the deans disagreed or strongly disagreed.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further shift is found in responses to the statement related to offering
Internet courses in nonbusiness programs. In response to the statement that “E
courses should be offered in nonbusiness programs,” 52% of the chairpersons
and 63% of the deans either agreed or strongly agreed, and only 10% of the
chairpersons and 6% of the deans disagreed with the statement.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opinions of accounting department chairpersons are about evenly
split on the subject of offering Internet courses in accounting programs but
are more tolerant of offering them in non-accounting programs. In fact, a
majority of the respondents believed they should be offered in nonbusiness
programs. Whether these views stem from a belief that accounting
topics are less amenable to being mastered over the Internet or whether it
is simply a “not in my area” reaction is not known. Independent study
courses typically lack the structure, deadlines, and regular face-to-face
student-instructor interaction that traditional courses possess. Most would
agree that some topics are more easily learned through independent study
than are others. Perhaps all that the respondents are conveying is that
structure, deadlines, and student-faculty interaction is more important in
accounting and business topics than in other areas.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As can be seen in Figure 1, the data indicate that COB deans have a
significantly (at the 0.018 level) more favorable view of Internet courses than do
accounting department chairpersons. This difference may be attributable to the
different concerns of deans and accounting chairs. Deans are undoubtedly more
concerned with the financial aspects of offering courses and might, therefore,
more strongly support new enrollments and new sources of revenue. Accounting
chairs might be more concerned with the quality of the courses being offered.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounting chairpersons move from being split on offering Internet
courses in accounting programs to supporting their offering in business
programs to more strongly supporting them in nonbusiness programs. The
support of deans, however, is stronger for offering Internet courses in business
programs than for offering them in nonbusiness programs. Apparently, 4.7%
of the deans moved from supporting Internet courses in business programs to
being neutral on offering them in nonbusiness programs. This may indicate
a hands-off attitude toward programs in other colleges.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, deans support offering Internet courses in accounting and
business degree programs more strongly than do accounting chairs. These</p>

        <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/image3.jpg" alt="OFFERING INTERNET COURSES">
        <p style="text-align: justify;">differences were significant at the 0.000 and the 0.003 level for accounting
and business programs respectively. The opinions of chairs and deans on
offering Internet courses in nonbusiness programs were not significantly
different at the 0.05 level.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: left;"><b>Offering Degrees Solely Through Internet Courses</b></h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next area considered dealt with the question of awarding degrees
based solely on completion of Internet courses. In response to the statement
that “A student should be able to obtain a degree in Accounting by taking only
E courses,” an overwhelming 91% of chairpersons and 70% of deans disagreed
or strongly disagreed. A surprising 72%, almost three quarters of the accounting
chairpersons, and 41% of deans strongly disagreed with the statement.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responses were not much different regarding the offering of degrees in
business or in nonbusiness programs based solely on the completion of
Internet courses. More than 90% of chairpersons and 72% of deans disagreed
or strongly disagreed that business degrees should be offered solely over the
Internet. On offering degrees in nonbusiness areas with all courses completed
over the Internet, 82% of the chairs and 58% of deans disagreed or strongly
disagreed while only 7% of the chairs and 15% of deans agreed or strongly
agreed. The only noticeable shift in responses to the three statements is a move
of about 14% of the deans from the disagree to the neutral category when
considering Internet degrees in nonbusiness programs compared with accounting
and business programs.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As vividly illustrated in Figure 2, accounting chairpersons are solidly
opposed to universities offering degrees in any academic discipline totally
through the Internet. They apparently believe that the campus experience
gives the student a component of education that should not be left out of
the degree experience. Deans are somewhat less opposed, and signifi-</p>

        <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/image4.jpg" alt="OFFERING INTERNET DEGREES">
        <p style="text-align: justify;">cantly less opposed than are accounting chairs, to offering degrees totally
through Internet courses but a solid majority still does not believe that
Internet degrees should be offered in any academic area. Little doubt
exists that a degree that does not contain the campus experience is
different from one that does. Whether it is better or worse is a question left
for time and experience to answer.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: left;"><b>Enrolling On-Campus Students and Proctoring of Exams</b></h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One complication that universities face with Internet courses is that of
on-campus students registering for courses and causing regular on-campus
courses to have low enrollments. Because Internet courses are normally paid
as an overload course, this shift in enrollment may result in less efficient use
of one of the university's most costly resources, professors' class time. This
issue was addressed by the statement: “When E courses are offered, they
should be available to on-campus as well as off-campus students.” A
substantial majority of respondents, 68% of chairs and 89% of deans, agreed
that on-campus students should have the same access to Internet courses as
off-campus students.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue that faces designers and instructors of Internet courses is
the proctoring of exams. Two statements addressed this issue. The first stated,
“When E-courses are offered, SOME exams should be proctored by an
independent person.” Sixty-six percent of the chairpersons and 69% of deans
agreed. Only 14% of chairs and 15% of deans disagreed with this statement.
A companion statement, "When E courses are offered, ALL exams should be
proctored by an independent person," had 49% of the chairs and 50% of deans
in agreement. Less than one-fourth, 23% of chairs and 20% of deans disagreed
with the statement.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Figure 3 illustrates, the support of deans for making Internet courses
available to all students was significantly stronger than that of the chairs.
Perhaps accounting chairpersons and COB deans view this issue from a
perspective of fairness; when Internet courses are offered they believe that all
students should have equal access to them. Also, some independent confirmation
of the level of student learning with Internet courses is essential. By more
than a four to one margin, proctoring of some exams is considered essential
and the proctoring of all exams is preferred by more than a two to one margin.
The attitudes of chairs and deans on the proctoring of exams were not
significantly different.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align: left;"><b>Visiting Campus</b></h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some universities that offer degrees solely through completion of
Internet courses require students to come to campus for some of the
classes during a term. Three statements were included that referred to that
facet of Internet courses. When asked if students completing an Internet
course should be required to come to campus at least once during the
course, 49% of the chairs and 33% of deans agreed. An interesting note is
that of the 33.8% of deans that agreed, 24% strongly agreed, and only 9%
of the 34% that disagreed, strongly disagreed.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question related to requiring more than one campus visit
during the course. A slightly smaller percentage of respondents, 41% of chairs
and 31% of deans, agreed with this statement than agreed with the previous
statement. The third statement relating to visiting campus asked, “If more than
once, how many times in a three-semester hour course?” and 39 of the 92
chairs (42%) entered a number. The average number of campus visits
indicated by respondents for students completing Internet courses was 5.54
times during the course. For deans who entered a number of campus visits (43</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be little disagreement that the student-to-student and the
student-to-instructor interaction is less in Internet courses than in traditional
courses. A valid concern is whether this reduced interaction makes them less
valuable to the student. By a more than six to one margin (82% to 13%)
accounting chairs agreed that the reduced level of interaction in Internet
courses makes them less valuable to students. Deans were about evenly split
on the issue with 47% agreeing and 43% disagreeing.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the graph shows, by almost a two to one margin (49% to 27%) accounting chairs believe the campus experience is a valuable component of
a university course and that it should not be left completely out of Internet
courses, while COB deans are about evenly split on the issue. Chairpersons
favor requiring more than one visit, although by a slimmer margin, and deans
shift slightly against requiring more than one campus visit. Accounting
chairpersons strongly believe that a course that contains less student-tostudent
or student-to-instructor interaction is a move in the wrong direction
and the course is less valuable to the student; deans do not share this view. The
difference in the views of chairs and deans on this question was significant at
the 0.000 level.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">chairpersons nor COB deans appear to share Noam’s view of the Internet’s impact on the “traditional university.”</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some universities that offer degrees solely through completion of
Internet courses require students to come to campus for some of the
classes during a term. Three statements were included that referred to that
facet of Internet courses. When asked if students completing an Internet
course should be required to come to campus at least once during the
course, 49% of the chairs and 33% of deans agreed. An interesting note is
that of the 33.8% of deans that agreed, 24% strongly agreed, and only 9%
of the 34% that disagreed, strongly disagreed.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responses to a similar statement, “As the number of E-courses grows, the importance of the university professor will diminish,” were very similar to those relating to the university. Agreeing with the statement were 34% of the
chairs and 18% of deans, while 55% of the chairs and 72% of deans disagreed
with it. As with the university, neither accounting chairpersons nor COB
deans are very apprehensive about any negative effects of expanded Internet
course offerings on university professors. However, chairs were significantly
more concerned about the impact of Internet courses on the university and on
the professor than were deans.</p> 
        <h2 style="text-align: left;"><b>Significant Relationships</b></h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pearson correlations were run and significance levels determined for the
relationships between responses to each of the 17 different statements for both
the chairs’ and the deans’ responses. Responses of the chairs to the first
statement that likened Internet courses to correspondence courses were
significantly related to nine of the other sixteen statements. For the deans,
Statement One responses were significantly related to five other statements.
That relationship was negative, and significant, for Statements Two through
Six for the chairs and Two through Four for the deans. Those results indicate
that when chairs and deans tended to agree that Internet courses were
“essentially correspondence courses,” they also tended to disagree that
universities should offer Internet courses in accounting, business, or nonbusiness
programs. In other words, respondents who thought Internet courses
were essentially correspondence courses were more inclined to believe that
Internet courses should not be offered in university programs. Accounting
chairpersons who viewed Internet courses as correspondence courses also
tended to believe that students should not be able to obtain degrees in
accounting or business by taking only Internet courses.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, chairpersons who viewed Internet courses as essentially
correspondence courses also tended to believe that all exams should be
proctored for Internet courses, that students should be required to come to
campus more than once, and that the student-to-student and instructor-tostudent
relationships that are missing make the courses less valuable to
students. As the respondents view Internet courses more like correspondence
courses, their opinion of Internet courses appears to be lower and more
restrictive.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deans who considered Internet courses to be correspondence courses did
not believe that all exams should be proctored, that students should be</p>

and instructor-to-student relationships make the courses less valuable
to students any more than deans who did not view Internet courses as
correspondence courses. They did, however, tend to believe more strongly
that “As the number of E-courses grows, the importance of the university
professor will diminish” and “If the importance of the university professor
diminishes, society will benefit” than did deans who did not see the Internet
course/correspondence course connection.</p> 
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One interesting observation is, as chairs and deans tended to agree with
the statement that “the student-to-student and the student-to-instructor interaction
that is missing in E-courses makes them less valuable to the student,”
they tended to disagree that Internet courses and Internet degrees should be
offered in accounting, business, or nonbusiness programs. Two exceptions to
this general observation are that, for deans, the relationships for offering
Internet courses in accounting and offering Internet degrees in nonbusiness
programs, and the interaction that is missing were only significant at the 0.059
and 0.098 levels respectively.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A surprising result was that deans who believed Internet courses were
essentially correspondence courses also tended to believe that “As the number
of Internet courses grows, the importance of the university professor will
diminish,” and “If the importance of the university professor diminishes,
society will benefit.” Chairs did not display that same tendency.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: left;"><b>Difference in COB Deans’ Opinions of Internet Courses</b></h2>
        <h2 style="text-align: left;"><b>Then Their Institutions Offer Internet Courses</b></h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questionnaire sent to the deans included Questions 18 and 19 which
relate to the offering of Internet courses in each dean’s college. Question 18
asked “Does your college or university currently offer E-courses?” Forty of
the deans responded in the affirmative (60%), 23 answered “no” (34%), and
3 did not indicate an answer.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deans of COBs where Internet courses were currently being offered
believed more strongly that Internet courses were not essentially correspondence
courses with a different delivery medium. They also tended to agree
more strongly that “E-courses should be offered in nonbusiness programs,”
that “A student should be able to obtain a degree in Business by taking only
E-courses,” and that “A student should be able to obtain a degree in
nonbusiness programs by taking only E-courses.” Additionally, deans at
schools that offer Internet courses disagreed more strongly with the notion
that “When E-courses are offered, the student should be required to come to
campus MORE THAN ONCE during the course.”</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COB deans at institutions that did not offer Internet courses were very
strongly opposed to offering Internet degrees. In fact, 81% were opposed to
offering Internet degrees in Accounting, 95% opposed offering them in
Business, and 77% opposed offering them in nonbusiness areas. Roughly
two-thirds of those opposed were strongly opposed to offering Internet
degrees in the different areas. Those percentages compare with 65% of COB
deans at institutions offering Internet courses opposed to offering Internet
degrees in Accounting, 60% opposed to offering them in Business, and 47%
opposed to offering them in nonbusiness areas. These differences could be a
reflection of additional familiarity with and knowledge of Internet courses
possessed by deans whose institutions offer Internet courses. On the other hand,
they could reflect an acceptance and tacit endorsement of events occurring at their
schools. Whichever is the case, the answer is beyond the scope of this data.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question 19 asked, “If no, (to Question 18) do you plan to offer Ecourses
in the next three years?” Of the 23 deans whose schools did not
offer Internet courses at that time, 12 planned to offer them within the next
three years and 11 indicated no plans to do so. Significant differences of
opinion existed between those who planned to offer Internet courses and
those who did not on only two questions. Deans who did not plan to offer
Internet courses believed more strongly that a student should NOT be able
to obtain a degree in Business by taking only Internet courses. They also
tended to agree more strongly that “When E-courses are offered, the
student should be required to come to campus MORE THAN ONCE
during the course.” Apparently, deans who do not plan to offer Internet
courses within the next three years are more skeptical about Internet
courses. That is consistent with the differences based on responses to
Statement 18, deans who do not currently offer Internet courses were more
skeptical than those who do.</p> 
        <h2 style="text-align:center;"><b>SUMMARY</b></h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opinions of accounting department chairpersons are about evenly split
on the subject of offering Internet courses in accounting programs but are
more tolerant of offering them in non-accounting programs. In fact, a majority
of the chairpersons believed they should be offered in nonbusiness programs.
COB deans, on the other hand, weigh in heavily in favor of offering Internet
courses in accounting, business and nonbusiness programs. Whether the
